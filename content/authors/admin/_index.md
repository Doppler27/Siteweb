Augustin Zinsou holds a master's degree in agroforestry ecology and adaptation from Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar. He was a research assistant at CIRAD-Senegal, where his research focused on assessing the impact of beneficial micro-organisms and organic residues on plant growth and soil microbial biodiversity as part of the VALIMAB and ACEPT-MAB projects. In addition to his academic results, he acquired laboratory techniques such as DNA extraction and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) at [LMI-IESOL](https://sites.google.com/site/iesolafrica/home). Augustin demonstrated his skills in managing the statistical analysis of data during his tenure, working under the supervision of Paula Fernandes, Ramatoulaye Samba-Mbaye, Fortuné Azihou, and Rodolphe Ahotonou.
